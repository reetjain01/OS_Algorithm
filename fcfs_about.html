            <h3>FCFS Disk Scheduling</h3>
            <p><b>Disk Scheduling Algorithm</b> is an algorithm that keeps and manages input and output requests arriving for the disk in a system. As we know, for executing any process memory is required. And when it comes to accessing things from a hard disk, the process becomes very slow as a hard disk is the slowest part of our computer. There are various methods by which the process can be scheduled and can be done efficiently.
            <br><br>
            <b>FCFS </b> stands for 'first-come-first-serve'. As the name suggests, the request which comes first will be processed first and so on. The requests coming to the disk are arranged in a proper sequence as they arrive. Since every request is processed in this algorithm, so there is no chance of 'starvation'.

                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <p>FCFS Disk Scheduling Algorithm consists following advantages :
                <ul>
                   <li>First Come First Serve algorithm has a very simple logic, it executes the process requests one by one in the sequence they arrive.</li>
                   <li>Thus, First Come First Serve is very simple and easy to understand and implement.</li> 
                    <li>In FCFS eventually, each and every process gets a chance to execute, so no starvation occur.</li> 
                </ul>

                <h4>Dis-Advantages</h4>
                <p>FCFS Disk Scheduling algorithm consists following disadvantages :
                    <ul>
                  <li>This scheduling algorithm is nonpreemptive, which means the process can’t be stopped in middle of execution and will run it’s full course.</li> 
                   <li>FCFS being a nonpreemptive scheduling algorithm, the short processes which are at the back of the queue have to wait for the long process at the front to finish</li>
                   <li>The throughput of FCFS is not very efficient.</li>
                   <li>FCFS is implemented on small systems only where input-output efficiency is not of utmost importance..</li>
                </ul>
